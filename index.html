       <p class="paragraph">Among the various food plants, fruits and vegetables (FAV) are reported to have health-improving benefits.[1–Citation3] Some FAV such as the citrus fruits (orange, grapefruit, lime, lemon), grapes, pomegranates, apples, dates, green and yellow vegetables (peppers), cabbage, strawberries, carrots, dark leafy greens, and banana,[Citation4–6] have been known worldwide to contain antioxidants. A characteristic of antioxidants is that they exert both additive and synergistic effects in reducing the risk of chronic diseases.[Citation7–9] Fruits and vegetables, therefore, exert protective roles against chronic diseases such as cardio- and cerebrovascular, ocular and neurological diseases, strokes, cancer, diabetes, hypertension, and blood-related diseases.[Citation10–15] Several epidemiological studies have presented compelling evidence that the potential of FAV to combat the majority of these health conditions are associated with the natural compounds found in them.[Citation1,Citation4] Low intake of FAV was estimated to be responsible for 31% of ischemic heart disease and 11% of stroke worldwide.[Citation2] In the report of the joint FAO/WHO consultation on diet, nutrition, and prevention of chronic diseases, a minimum daily intake of 400–500 g per day of FAV was recommended for the prevention of high blood pressure, stroke, cardiovascular diseases, and other micronutrient related deficiencies.[Citation2,Citation7] Inadequate intake of FAV is therefore a significant risk-factor that causes several nutritionally related non-communicable diseases (NCDs)</p>
